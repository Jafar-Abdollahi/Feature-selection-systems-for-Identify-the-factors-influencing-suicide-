Suicide is a major public health problem, and suicide rates are still on the rise. Current strategies for identifying individuals at risk for suicide, such as the use of a patient's self-reported suicidal ideation or evidence of past suicide attempts, have not been sufficient in reducing suicide rates. The availability of huge amounts of medical data leads to the need for powerful learning tools to help medical experts to diagnose suicide diseases.  Machine learning methods are helpful in the diagnosis of suicide disease, showing a reasonable level of efficiency. But these data are redundant and are noisy in nature, which negatively affects the process of observing knowledge and useful patterns. Machine learning techniques have attracted big attention from researchers to turn such data into useful knowledge. Furthermore, relevant data can be extracted from huge records using filter-based feature selection methods.
