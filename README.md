# Feature-selection-systems-for-Identify-the-factors-influencing-suicide-
Suicide is a major public health problem, and suicide rates are still on the rise. Current strategies for identifying individuals at risk for suicide, such as the use of a patient's self-reported suicidal ideation or evidence of past suicide attempts, have not been sufficient in reducing suicide rates. The availability of huge amounts of medical data leads to the need for powerful learning tools to help medical experts to diagnose suicide diseases.  Machine learning methods are helpful in the diagnosis of suicide disease, showing a reasonable level of efficiency. But these data are redundant and are noisy in nature, which negatively affects the process of observing knowledge and useful patterns. Machine learning techniques have attracted big attention from researchers to turn such data into useful knowledge. Furthermore, relevant data can be extracted from huge records using filter-based feature selection methods.

<h2> GUI </h2>
This study's primary goal is to categorise and diagnose suicide by utilising feature selection and machine learning methods. To find the useful characteristics in the dataset, feature selection is first applied. After this, ML algorithms are trained on the dataset to identify the optimum feature for output classification.

A.	Feature Selection
To select the most informative features for classification, we employed several feature selection techniques, including XGBClassifier, RFECV, RF, LR, AdaBoost, Lasso and Ridge Regularization, Gradient Boost Tree Importance, and Estimation of Coefficients of Linear Regression. These techniques were utilized to analyze the suicide dataset and identify relevant features for classification. The Categorization of feature selection algorithms based on search strategy, evaluation criteria, and data mining tasks showed in Table 1.

<h2> Conlusion </h2>
The health care service system plays a pivotal role in the medical domain that constitutes massive demands of human life. To evolve, healthcare providers in developing countries are using intelligent technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques. Regarding AI integration, advancements in health care have led research on human-centered healthcare intelligent systems. AI technologies exert influence on the development of intensive care and supervisory activities in hospitals and clinics. According to the extensive research that Jafar Abdollahi and colleagues has done in the field of disease diagnosis with artificial intelligence since 2019, Artificial intelligence including Machine learning and deep learning has been successfully utilized in medical image and healthcare [21-32]. Suicide rates are among the most serious problems in the world. The frequency of suicides in Ardabil, Iran is rising dramatically every year. For this reason, research is being done to anticipate the causes of suicide by utilising machine learning algorithms and data mining approaches to pinpoint the underlying causes. It is thought that the suggested method's encouraging outcomes can be used to help doctors make more accurate and thorough diagnoses in their practice.
